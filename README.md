# notion-capture

[Notion](https://notion.com/) is missing a good capture interface
as in "I just had this thought and need to capture it immediately
with minimal interruption."

This library and CLI provide an interface
to quickly capture thoughts and tasks
inside of a Notion database
so that they can be picked up later.
