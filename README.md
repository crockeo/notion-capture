# notion-cli

[Notion](https://notion.com/) is a great productivity tool,
but it's missing a couple key features to round out my productivity story.
This CLI provides some of those features:

```
Usage: notion-cli <command>
  capture     Interactively capture a task from the terminal.
  complete    Tag items with the time at which they were completed.
```

This project is a work in progress,
so there is minimal documentation.
As I get closer to a steady feature set
I will write up docs to help others get started.
